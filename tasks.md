# Tasks for Robotics Explanations

## Phase: Content Creation

### Goal
Generate detailed explanations for key robotics concepts and suggest appropriate diagrams.

### Implementation Tasks

- [ ] T001 [P] Write "Computer Vision" explanation for humanoid robots in docs/robotics_explanations.md
- [ ] T002 [P] Write "Motion Planning" explanation with examples in docs/robotics_explanations.md
- [ ] T003 [P] Write "Reinforcement Learning in Robotics" explanation in docs/robotics_explanations.md
- [ ] T004 [P] Write "Real-time Decision Making" explanation in docs/robotics_explanations.md
- [ ] T005 [P] Write "Sensor Fusion" explanation and examples in docs/robotics_explanations.md
- [ ] T006 [P] Suggest diagrams for each subsection in docs/robotics_explanations.md

## Dependencies

All content creation tasks can be performed in parallel.

## Parallel Execution Examples

- Simultaneously write explanations for "Computer Vision" and "Motion Planning".
- Work on "Reinforcement Learning in Robotics" while "Sensor Fusion" is being drafted.

## Implementation Strategy

The content will be incrementally added to `docs/robotics_explanations.md`. Each explanation will be a distinct subsection. Diagrams will be suggested in context with their respective explanations.
