## Response snapshot

The feature specification for "Introduction to Physical AI" has been created at specs/1-intro-physical-ai/spec.md, and a corresponding quality checklist at specs/1-intro-physical-ai/checklists/requirements.md. The spec is complete and ready for the next phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created and validated the feature specification, including user scenarios, requirements, success criteria, and assumptions for the "Introduction to Physical AI" section.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Created specs/1-intro-physical-ai/spec.md and specs/1-intro-physical-ai/checklists/requirements.md.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Next would typically be /sp.plan.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully created feature specification and performed initial quality validation, overcoming the issue of a missing PowerShell script by manually performing the file and branch creation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: create-new-feature.ps1 script not found, manually performed feature setup.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
