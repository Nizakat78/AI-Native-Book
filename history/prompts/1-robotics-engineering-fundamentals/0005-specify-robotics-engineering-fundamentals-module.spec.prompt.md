## Prompt

```text
/sp.specify
Module 1 – Section 3: Robotics Engineering Fundamentals
- Explain kinematics (forward and inverse) with simple examples
- Explain dynamics: motion, force, torque basics
- Describe Degrees of Freedom (DoF) and examples in humanoid robots
- Explain basic principles of balance and stability in robots
- Suggest diagrams for kinematics chains, DoF, and stability
- Content should be clear, structured, and educational for students
```

## Response snapshot

Created the feature specification for Module 1, Section 3: Robotics Engineering Fundamentals, detailing requirements for kinematics, dynamics, DoF, balance, and visual aids.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Feature specification created successfully.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (manual review against user input was performed).
- 📁 Files: `specs/1-robotics-engineering-fundamentals/spec.md` created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now proceed with planning (e.g., `/sp.plan`) or task generation (e.g., `/sp.tasks`) for Module 1, Section 3.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully created the spec file and generated the PHR using agent-native methods.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: N/A
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
