## Prompt

```text
/sp.tasks
- Task 1: Write "Kinematics (Forward & Inverse)" explanation
- Task 2: Write "Dynamics (Motion, Force, Torque Basics)" explanation
- Task 3: Write "Degrees of Freedom (DoF)" explanation with examples
- Task 4: Write "Balance & Stability Basics" explanation
- Task 5: Suggest diagrams for each subsection
```

## Response snapshot

Generated `tasks.md` with 5 tasks for Module 1, Section 3, organized by user story, including diagram suggestions.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Tasks for Module 1, Section 3 generated successfully.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: `specs/1-robotics-engineering-fundamentals/tasks.md` created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Next step would be to start implementing the tasks (e.g., `/sp.implement`).
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully created the tasks file and generated the PHR using agent-native methods.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
