## Prompt

```text
- Task 1: Write "What is a Humanoid Robot?"
- Task 2: Write "Core Components of Humanoids"
- Task 3: Write "Sensors in Humanoids" with examples
- Task 4: Write "Actuators" with types and examples
- Task 5: Write "Control Systems" (feedback loops, algorithms)
- Task 6: Write "Energy Systems" (batteries, power management)
- Task 7: Write "Body Design Principles"
- Task 8: Add diagram suggestions for each subsection
```

## Response snapshot

Generated `tasks.md` with 8 tasks, organized by user story, including diagram suggestions.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Tasks for Module 1, Section 2 generated successfully.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: `tasks.md` created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Next step would be to start implementing the tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: The `create-phr.sh` script was not found, requiring manual PHR creation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `create-phr.sh` not found.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate why `create-phr.sh` is missing from the environment.
