# Quickstart Guide: Introduction to Physical AI Content Generation

**Feature**: [Introduction to Physical AI](specs/1-intro-physical-ai/spec.md)
**Date**: 2025-12-06

## 1. Content Generation (Conceptual)

The primary content for Section 1: Introduction to Physical AI will be generated by an AI agent based on the `spec.md` and `data-model.md` documents. This process is conceptual at this stage and assumes the availability of such an agent.

## 2. Visual Generation (Conceptual)

Diagrams and visuals will be generated by an AI agent based on the "Diagram Suggestion" placeholders within the content. This is also a conceptual step at this planning phase.

## 3. Viewing the Content (Docusaurus)

Once the markdown content is generated and placed in the Docusaurus `docs/module1/` directory (e.g., as `intro-physical-ai.mdx`), it can be viewed by:

1.  **Setting up Docusaurus locally**: If not already set up, follow the official Docusaurus installation guide.
2.  **Running the development server**: Navigate to your Docusaurus project root and run `npm start` (or `yarn start`).
3.  **Accessing in browser**: Open your web browser to the address provided by the Docusaurus development server (typically `http://localhost:3000`). Navigate to the relevant section (`/module1/intro-physical-ai`).

This document describes the conceptual steps for content and visual generation and the practical steps for viewing the generated content within a Docusaurus environment.
