# Implementation Plan: Module 1 – Section 4: AI in Robotics

**Branch**: `1-ai-in-robotics-m1s4` | **Date**: 2025-12-06 | **Spec**: [specs/1-ai-in-robotics-m1s4/spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/1-ai-in-robotics-m1s4/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the structure and approach for creating educational content on AI in robotics, focusing on computer vision, motion planning, reinforcement learning, real-time decision-making, and sensor fusion for humanoid robots. It will ensure content is clear, structured, and includes definitions, examples, and diagram placeholders, suitable for AI-assisted generation and student learning. The content will be formatted in Markdown, using H2 for sections and H3 for topics, and will be modular for AI-assisted generation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown (for content), English
**Primary Dependencies**: N/A (content generation, focuses on conceptual explanations)
**Storage**: Filesystem (for storing Markdown content files)
**Testing**: Content review and validation against pedagogical principles for clarity, accuracy, flow, and student comprehension.
**Target Platform**: Digital textbook/documentation, primarily for web-based consumption.
**Project Type**: Educational Content Generation/Documentation
**Performance Goals**: N/A (content quality and pedagogical effectiveness are primary metrics)
**Constraints**: Adherence to project constitution principles, modularity for AI-assisted generation, clear and structured explanations for beginner students, consistency with previous module sections.
**Scale/Scope**: Module 1, Section 4 of a larger textbook series, covering specific AI concepts in robotics.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **Clarity**: All technical and pedagogical aspects are clear and unambiguous.
- [x] **Accuracy**: All technical information, facts, and code are rigorously accurate.
- [x] **Pedagogical Flow**: Concepts are introduced with a logical and intuitive progression.
- [x] **AI-Native Textbook Style**: Content adopts a modular, structured, and semantically rich format for AI parsing.
- [x] **Example-Driven Explanations**: Significant ideas are accompanied by clear, concise, and executable examples.
- [x] **Beginner-Friendly Guidance**: Content assumes minimal prior knowledge and provides comprehensive explanations.
- [x] **Modular Structure for AI-assisted Content Generation**: Sections are self-contained to facilitate AI modification and expansion.
